You find yourself at the edge of the **Whispering Woods**, a place of ancient magic and forgotten secrets. Local legends speak of a lost artifact, the 'Sunstone', hidden deep within. It is said to have the power to heal the blighted lands.

Before you lies a fork in the path.

- To your **right**, the path follows a murmuring stream.

**What do you do?** (e.g., "Go left into the trees" or "Follow the stream to the right")
